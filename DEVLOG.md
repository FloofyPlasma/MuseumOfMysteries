  I created a Vec2 class, it is being used in some places as a replacement for passing positions to objects.

  <summary>October 28, 2024: Basic mouse handling</summary>
  
  - Complete: Mouse class
  - Complete: Cursor class

  I replaced the default system cursor with a custom one I load from the Cursor asset pack.
  Right now, the cursor is pretty static, but its laying the framework for expansion in the future.
  I didn't have a lot of motivation to work today, and I just wanted to get at least something
